# clj-github
A Clojure library for interacting with the github developer API.

Note: while this library is being used for several production use cases, we're still ironing out the APIs, so they are subject to change.

## tests

To run tests:

```
lein test
```

## examples

If you'd like an example of this library in action, check out [`ordnungsamt`](https://github.com/nubank/ordnungsamt), which is a tool for applying ad-hoc code migrations to a set of github repositories and subsequently opening pull requests for them.
